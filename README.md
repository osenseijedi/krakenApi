This is a java client for the Kraken API.

This lib was heavily inspired by Stephane Bouclier's lib : https://github.com/sbouclier/kraken-java-api-client

Usage is pretty much the same.

Checkout the class Main.java for some immediate examples. 

The biggest difference is that an object "ApiJsonExchange" is available and allows one to access as much info as possible
on the call.
This was made specifically for traceability and auditing.

Feel free to create issues/PR for any bugs and/or improvements.


## Run the Main class

Compile and run with
```
./gradlew build run
```
